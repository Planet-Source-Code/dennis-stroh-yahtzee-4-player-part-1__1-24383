### Description

This is a full version game with complete source code. It is colorful, easy and fun to play.

Although the code is commented, I also used long variable names to make the code sort of self-commenting.

The game, I think is a fairly robust version of Yahtzee with these helpful features:

* Tips on the point value of the dices after each roll,

* Highlighting of those scoring categories which will yield points

* Sound effects (which can be muted)

* Dice color choices

* A help section

* Four player capability

* Ability to save a game in progress

* Tracking of top 10 high scores

This is part 1. Part 2 has help form and associated images (which I am having trouble uploading)
